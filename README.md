# Transfer-Assist
Transfer Assist is an online counselor for transfer students applying to college. Transfer Assist uses information provided by Assist.org to generate efficient, practical, and ambitious schedule plans based on the needs of the student. Transfer Assist finds and organizes courses that meet the application criteria of the colleges the student intends to apply to and generates multiple education plans for the student to choose from. This tool not only helps students, but also counselors, parents, and even colleges as they work on setting standards for what they want in their students.
