			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>Transfer Assist is an online tool for transfer students applying to college. 
				Transfer Assist uses information provided by Assist.org to generate efficient, 
				practical, and ambitious schedule plans based on the needs of the student. 
				Transfer Assist generates multiple education plans consisting of classes that 
				meet multiple criteria for the student to choose from. This tool not only helps 
				students, but also counselors, parents, and even colleges as they work on 
				setting standards for what they want in their students.
